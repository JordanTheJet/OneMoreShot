# One More Shot - Characters

*Set in Boston*

## Marcus Cole (The Player)
A high school point guard about to play the biggest game of his life.

- **Present Day (Scene 4):** Focused, carrying the weight of memory. About to take the championship shot that will define his legacy—and honor his brother's.
- **In Memories (Scenes 1-3):** Younger Marcus, learning from his older brother. Eyes full of admiration, eager to absorb every lesson.

## Jeffrey Cole (The Brother)
Marcus's older brother. A basketball prodigy taken too soon—died at 14, just before starting high school. His presence—and absence—shapes the entire story.

- **Scenes 1-2:** The mentor, the idol (age 13-14 in memories). Already the best player in the neighborhood. Patient teacher with effortless skill. Guides young Marcus with encouraging words.
- **Scene 3:** Conspicuously absent. Represented by an empty chair and a framed photograph. His loss is felt deeply at the family gathering.
- **Scene 4:** Lives on in memory. His teachings echo in Marcus's form, his spirit present in the final shot.

## D (The Best Friend)
Marcus's closest friend and teammate. Knew Jeffrey too. The one who's been there through the grief.

- **Scene 4:** On the court with Marcus. Passes him the ball before the final shot. A look of understanding between them—no words needed.
- Loyal, supportive, knows what this game means to Marcus.

## Mom (Mrs. Cole)
The heart of the family, holding everyone together after Jeffrey's passing.

- **Scene 3:** At the dining room table during the gathering. Trying to stay strong. Her grief is quiet but visible.
- Warm presence, but tired. The empty chair hits her hardest.

## The Whispered Line

At the climax, before the final shot:
> *"One more shot..."*

The only dialogue in the game. Whether it's Marcus speaking to himself, or Jeffrey's voice in memory, is left ambiguous.
